Make slides to explain and compare the different software licenses
and a decisions matrix to compare them

Nicht alle Creative-Commons-Lizenzen sind auch freie Lizenzen.

Wirklich freie Creative-Commons Lizenzen sind z. B. CC BY oder CC BY-SA, wie sie auch die Wikipedia nutzt.

Die NC- und ND-Attribute machen Inhalte/Werke unfrei!

The organization has also shown a preference for “permissive” licenses,
such as Apache, over “copyleft” licenses like the GPL, under which both GNU and Linux
— the two major components of a Linux desktop distro — are licensed.
This is understandable, as most corporate users and developers of open source prefer licenses
hat keep the door open for them to employ the code into proprietary projects.

Torvalds at LinuxCon Part III: Permissive Licenses and Org Charts
-> BSD use case

http://fossforce.com/2016/09/torvalds-linuxcon-permissive-licenses-org-charts/

“I think that if you actually want to create something bigger,
and if you want to create a community around it, the BSD license is not necessarily a great license.

“I mean, it’s worked fairly well, but you are going to have trouble finding outside developers
who feel protected by a big company that says, ‘Hey, here’s this BSD license thing and we’re not making
any promises because the copyright allows us to do anything, and allows you to do anything too.’
But as an outside developer, I would not get the warm and fuzzies by that, because I’m like,
‘Oh, this big company is going to take advantage of me,’ while the GPL says,
‘Yes, the company may be big, but nobody’s ever going to take advantage of your code.
It will remain free and nobody can take that away from you.’ I think that’s a big deal for community management.

“It wasn’t something I was planning personally when I started, but over the years
I’ve become convinced that the BSD license is great for code you don’t care about.

I’ll use it myself. If there’s a library routine that I just want to say ‘hey,
this is useful to anybody and I’m not going to maintain this,’ I’ll put it under the BSD license.”
